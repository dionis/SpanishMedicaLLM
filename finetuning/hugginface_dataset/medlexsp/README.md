SHARING/ACCESS/CONTEXT INFORMATION

1. Usage Licenses/restrictions placed on the data (please indicate if different data files have different usage license):

The Medical Lexicon for Spanish gathers terms from several sources:
- Terminologies in the Spanish language in the UMLS® Metathesaurus: the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), the World Health Organization (WHO) Adverse Drug Reactions terminology, the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT®). MedLexSp also includes terms mapped to Spanish through the UMLS from the English versions of the International Classification of Diseases vs. 10 (ICD-10), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5®) and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM®) catalog of genes and genetic disorders.
- A subset of terms from the Diccionario de términos médicos (DTM) developed by Unidad de Terminología Médica (Real Academia Nacional de Medicina de España), in collaboration with Asociación Latinoamericana de Academias Nacionales de Medicina, España y Portugal (ALANAM).
- Supplementary terminological sources such as the Anatomical Therapeutical Classification from the WHO, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Dictionary of Cancer Terms, OrphaData from INSERM, or the Nomenclátor de Prescripción from AEMPS. 
- Corpus-based terms derived from the Spanish version of MedlinePlus (supported by the National Library of Medicine), Summaries of Product Characteristics in Spanish from the Spanish Drug Effect database, and the Chilean Waiting List Corpus.
- Terms from the following named entity recognition challenges and shared tasks: CANTEMIST, CODIESP and PharmaCoNER (see point 6)

Terms from the Diccionario panhispánico de términos médicos (Real Academia Nacional de Medicina de España) and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH, by BIREME) were obtained through a distribution and usage agreement from the corresponding institutions who develop them.

The version of MedLexSp freely available does not include terms or coding data from terminological sources with copyright rights (MedDRA and SNOMED-CT); only the subset of data in MedLexSp without usage restrictions is accessible.
